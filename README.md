## My personal site and blog: Jakebot.com

I use [metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) as a static site generator. I'm a big fan of its flexibility.
This site uses a pretty standard metalsmith setup with nunjucks templating.

### How it works

Metalsmith runs on node, so that's a dependency.

There are three tasks: setup, serve, and deploy. [Setup](https://github.com/jakelear/jakebot.com/blob/master/setup.js) is the primary metalsmith workhorse, used by both of the other tasks. [Serve](https://github.com/jakelear/jakebot.com/blob/master/serve.js) is for use in the development environment and will serve the site locally and initialize [browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) to watch and livereload. [Deploy](https://github.com/jakelear/jakebot.com/blob/master/deploy.js) is for pushing the site to s3 and uses [bucketful](https://github.com/jakobmattsson/bucketful) - I wrote about how I set this up for [easy s3 deployment of metalsmith sites.](http://jakebot.com/posts/2016/3/14/deploying-to-s3-with-metalsmith-and-bucketful/)
