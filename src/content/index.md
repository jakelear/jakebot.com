My name is **Jake Lear**. I build applications and sites for the internet. I currently work with the [product team](http://product.voxmedia.com) at [Vox Media](http://voxmedia.com). On the side, I spend my time making art and developing small games. I occasionally write about web development and video games [here](/posts), and you can read about some of my projects [here](/projects).
